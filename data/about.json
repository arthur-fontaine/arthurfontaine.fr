I am currently studying Solutions Architecture as part of a Master's degree at EEMI.\n\nBeing a very imaginative person and passionate about new technologies, my first computer and coding project at the age of 12 changed my life. My mind was able to channel itself and I was able to bring some of my dream projects to life.\n\nToday, I love building tools that make developers' lives easier. I often say \"I make dumb tools for dumb developers\"."
